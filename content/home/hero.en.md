## Website  about R (by [Rubén Fernández-Casal](/en/#about))

You will find here tools (and machinery) about R in [Spanish](/)...

The web of the [***npsp***](https://rubenfcasal.github.io/npsp) 
package is (mainly) in English.

You can also visit my [institutional web](http://dm.udc.es/staff/ruben_fernandez/) 
(also in English).
